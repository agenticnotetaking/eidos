Pull should climb *up* from code to intent, not translate *across* from code to prose.

Code → prose about code is horizontal (architecture's job).
Code → intent the code serves is vertical (pull's job).

The question pull answers is: "what would someone need to know to *re-implement* this differently?"
Not: "what does this code do?"
