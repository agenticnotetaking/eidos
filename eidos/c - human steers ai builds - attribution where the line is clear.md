Most eidos output is collaboration — human direction and feedback, AI writing and research.
The line between contributions blurs in specs, claims, and code.

Attribution makes sense where the back-and-forth is the point:
- Refinement files capture verbatim Q&A — who said what matters
- Meta files analyse outputs through dialogue — the exchange is the insight
- Goodjob files record what worked and who proposed it

In other places — specs, claims, skill definitions — the output is joint.
Trying to attribute each sentence would be artificial.
The git history shows who typed, but the thinking was shared.

This is not a limitation to work around.
It's the collaboration model: human steers, AI builds, the result belongs to neither alone.
