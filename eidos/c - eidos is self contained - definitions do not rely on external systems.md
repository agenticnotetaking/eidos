tldr: Eidos specs and definitions must be understandable on their own without external system knowledge
---

# Eidos is self contained — definitions do not rely on external systems

Eidos specs must be self-contained. Definitions, conventions, and terminology should be explained within eidos itself, not by reference to external systems like mono or any other workflow tool.

This doesn't mean eidos can't learn from other systems — research todos and notes may reference external sources as context for what to extract or adapt. But the resulting specs and definitions must stand alone. A reader encountering eidos for the first time should understand it without needing to know anything else.
