# Specs emerge from discussions and serve as fixpoints, not required reading

Specs typically get created based on brief discussions in sessions.
A conversation surfaces an insight, a concern, or a design direction — and that gets externalised into a spec file.

The point is not that you have to read every last spec.
The point is that when you notice something is off, the spec is where you go to make the correction persist.
It's an externalised fixpoint: easy to find, easy to change, and durable across sessions.

This has implications:

- **Creation is low-ceremony.**
Rough ideas in chat become specs.
The [[spec - toeidos skill - routes insights into specs and claims]] skill formalises this pathway.
- **Reading is selective.**
You read what's relevant to your current work.
Session hooks and drift analysis surface what matters — you don't need to front-load all specs into context.
- **Correction is the primary value.**
A spec that nobody reads still has value if, when something goes wrong, it's the place where the fix gets recorded.
The spec outlives the chat that created it.
