# human.md is a scratchpad for uncommitted human thinking

`human.md` at the project root is a freeform scratchpad for prompts, answers, ideas, and notes that haven't been committed into the system yet.

It belongs entirely to the human.
AI must never read, edit, or reference its contents.

When the human is ready, they move items from `human.md` into the appropriate location — specs, claims, memory, or CLAUDE.md.
Until then, it stays untouched.
