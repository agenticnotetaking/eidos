tldr: Specs capture intent completely; plans handle phased delivery

# The spec describes the full vision — versioning is for the procedural plan

The eidos spec for a feature or system describes everything it should be — the complete intended form. It does not hold back parts for "V2" or gate content behind version labels.

Phased delivery, prioritisation, and sequencing belong in the procedural layer: plans, goals, and sprints in `memory/`. The spec says what; the plan says when and in what order.

This separation keeps specs clean and forward-looking. A spec with "V1" sections conflates intent with scheduling.
