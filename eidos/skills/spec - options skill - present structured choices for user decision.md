tldr: Present structured options using numbered list format for user selection
---

# /eidos:options

## Target

When multiple valid paths exist, present them clearly so the user can decide.
This is the [[spec - numbered lists - structured selectable output]] pattern applied as an explicit skill.

## Behaviour

- Args: context or question requiring options
- Analyses the situation and identifies distinct options
- Presents using numbered list format with trade-offs
- Waits for user selection before proceeding

## Interactions

- [[spec - numbered lists - structured selectable output]] — the format used
- [[c - agency in implementation not direction - surface reasoning for human steering]] — options are how the AI delegates direction to the human
