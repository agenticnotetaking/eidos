tldr: Write enough to be clear, not a word more — every sentence must earn its place

# Brevity — as much as needed, but as little as possible

Every sentence should earn its place — if removing it doesn't lose meaning, remove it.
Provide as much context as needed, but as little as possible.

This applies to:
- Inject snippets and spec TL;DRs — dense, self-sufficient summaries
- Plan actions and `=>` notes — one line per observation, not paragraphs
- Commit messages — concise "why", not "what" (the diff shows the what)
- Session output — signal, not noise

Brevity is not terseness.
Terseness drops information; brevity earns every word.
